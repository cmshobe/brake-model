summary:
  "BRaKE is a 1-D bedrock channel profile evolution model. It
  calculates bedrock erosion in addition to treating the delivery,
  transport, degradation, and erosion-inhibiting effects of large,
  hillslope-derived blocks of rock. It uses a shear-stress bedrock
  erosion formulation with additional complexity related to flow
  resistance, block transport and erosion, and delivery of blocks from
  the hillslopes."
